\f0\fs24 \cf0 The main goal of RSs is to predict the ratings for the items that the user has not consumed yet. Based on the predicted ratings, the suitable items (those with high predicted ratings) are selected and provided as the recommendations. Content-based (\\textbf\{CB\}) recommender systems \\citep\{pazzani2007content\} \'a0analyse the items\'92 descriptions in order to learn the user's preference for specific types of items. The prediction for the unseen item is based on the ratings for similar items by the same user. There are many limitations of CB systems: the system depends on the metadata which has to be explicitly associated with each item; overspecialisation due to the item-similarity paradigm; the users are not given serendipitous recommendations and the user is held in the so-called "filter bubble" \\citep\{pariser2011filter\}.\'a0In Collaborative Filtering (\\textbf\{CF\}) strategies the prediction for the unseen item is based on the opinion from users with similar tastes \\citep\{resnick1994grouplens\}. This approach ignores the items' metadata so cross-domain recommendations are possible (e.g., books, movies, music, etc.) by employing cross-domain techniques \\citep\{fernandez2012cross\}. After the Netflix prize competition \\citep\{bennett2007netflix\}, matrix factorization has become a popular CF technique \\citep\{Koren2008factorization,koren2009matrix, Koren2010\}. When a substantial amount of ratings are present in the system, these techniques tend to outperform other approaches. However, according to \\cite\{balabanovic1997fab\}, for the user whose tastes are unusual compared to the population, the similarity to other users will be poor, hence resulting in poor recommendations for such a user. Knowledge-Based (\\textbf\{KB\}) systems use knowledge from the domain expert in order to prepare meaningful recommendations \\citep\{schafer1999recommender\}. However, pure KB systems are not popular and widely used, since they are expensive due to the required input from the domain expert. In order to overcome the different problems with the CF and CB strategies, they are sometimes combined into the Hybrid RS \\citep\{burke2007hybrid\}. Furthermore, some context-aware techniques actually fall into the hybrid-system strategies, since the basic rating prediction can be made in one way and later adapted by the contextualization, e.g., post-filtering contextualization \\citep\{Adomavicius2011\}.\'a0}
