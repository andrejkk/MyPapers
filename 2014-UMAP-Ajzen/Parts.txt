At the basis of recommender systems is the prediction of the users' ratings, i.e. how much would an observed user like a specific content item \cite{Adomavicius2005Toward}. In order to achieve a high accuracy in the ratings predictions, researchers used different approaches to gather knowledge about the users' preferences: (i) from the usage history (i.e. the past ratings of the users) and (ii) from other sources of information (e.g. the Internet Movie Database\footnote{\url{http://imdb.com}} for movies' metadata). Two approaches to implement recommender systems emerged, the content-based (CB) approach (for example, see work by \cite{Pogacnik2005Personal}) and the collaborative filtering (CF) approach (e.g. \cite{Linden2003Amazon}). However, these early approaches relied on data-centric models to perform the ratings predictions.

Since recommender systems are basically a user-oriented tool a shift towards user-centric models has started recently. Researchers have started to investigate two types of user-oriented information: (i) personality and (ii) emotions. 

Personality is defined by \cite{McCrae1992Introduction} as the most important way in which individuals differ in their enduring emotional, interpersonal, experiential attitudinal and motivational styles. To describe a user's personality, the Five Factor Model (FFM) appears to be a good choice, since the personality is expressed with a vector of scalar values describing the five factors that account for the majority of variance among users: openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism \cite{McCrae1992Introduction}. Furthermore, there are freely available tools for measuring users' personalities, like the International Personality Item Pool\footnote{\url{http://ipip.ori.org}} \cite{Goldberg2006International}. \cite{Pennock2000Collaborative} introduced the term personality diagnosis in their recommender system as early as in 2000, although their definition of personality was a simple vector of user's ratings. In separate investigations, \cite{Hu2010Using} and \cite{Tkalcic2009Personality} used the FFM information to calculate user similarities for solving the new user problem in CF recommender systems.

If personality refers to enduring users' properties, emotions refer to states that users experience for shorter time periods. An emotion is usually a consequence of a stimulus, which can come from the outside (e.g. fear because we see a bear approaching) or from the inside (e.g. fear that we will be criticized for our work). Generally there are two approaches to describe emotions: (i) the basic emotions, which is a list of discrete classes \cite{Ekman1999Basic} and (ii) the dimensional space, where continuous factors (like valence, arousal and dominance) are used \cite{Tkalcic2010Using}. In recommender systems, emotions have been usually related to the stimuli, i.e. the content that induces emotions in end users. \cite{Hanjalic2005Affective} used low level features from video and audio to extract the emotions that a video-sequence induces in end users for the purpose of personalized video delivery. \cite{Soleymani2009Collaborative} built a video retrieval system based on affective labels and and continuous emotion description. \cite{Arapakis2010AffectBased} used induced face motion units as indicators of emotions to characterize video clips and perform a personalized selection. \cite{Tkalcic2010Using} built an item and user model using the valence, arousal and dominance parameters in an image recommender system and improved the system over generic metadata.

\subsection{Problem statement}\label{SubSec_}

Despite the fact that personality and emotions have been used to improve the accuracy of recommender systems, little qualitative analyses have been done so far to provide understandable insights on the underlying reasons for the performance improvement. The interpretation of the first two latent factors in the Netflix movie dataset\footnote{\url{http://www.netflixprize.com/}} showed that the first two factors, in terms of variance explanation, have a human-understandable meaning: intellectual-shallow (first factor) and masculilne-feminine (second factor) movies \cite{Koren2009Matrix}. Furthermore, a similar analysis \cite{Tkalcic2011Emotional} showed that in an image recommender system, the first factor is strongly correlated with affective factors, namely valence, arousal and dominance. 

In this paper we present the results of a qualitative analysis of the role of emotions and personality for item and user modeling in a recommender system (see Fig. \ref{fig:graphical_abstract}). When consuming multimedia content, end users experience various emotions that are caused by the content itself. We present the results of an analysis of the affective properties of the content stimuli used in our dataset. Human personality refers to the most important ways in which people differ \cite{McCrae1992Introduction}. We present a human understandable interpretation, from the personality perspective, of the first two latent factors of a recommender system dataset.
