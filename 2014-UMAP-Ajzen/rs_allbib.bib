abstract = {Extracting and validating emotional cues through analysis of users' facial expressions is of high importance for improving the level of interaction in man machine communication systems. Extraction of appropriate facial features and consequent recognition of the user's emotional state that can be robust to facial expression variations among different users is the topic of this paper. Facial animation parameters (FAPs) defined according to the ISO MPEG-4 standard are extracted by a robust facial analysis system, accompanied by appropriate confidence measures of the estimation accuracy. A novel neurofuzzy system is then created, based on rules that have been defined through analysis of FAP variations both at the discrete emotional space, as well as in the 2D continuous activation-evaluation one. The neurofuzzy system allows for further learning and adaptation to specific users' facial expression characteristics, measured though FAP estimation in real life application of the system, using analysis by clustering of the obtained FAP values. Experimental studies with emotionally expressive datasets, generated in the EC IST ERMIS project indicate the good performance and potential of the developed technologies.},

@article{Varni2010,
abstract = {This paper presents a multimodal system for real-time analysis of nonverbal affective social interaction in small groups of users. The focus is on two major aspects of affective social interaction: the synchronization of the affective behavior within a small group and the emergence of functional roles, such as leadership. A small group of users is modeled as a complex system consisting of single interacting components that can auto-organize and show global properties. Techniques are developed for computing quantitative measures of both synchronization and leadership. Music is selected as experimental test-bed since it is a clear example of interactive and social activity, where affective nonverbal communication plays a fundamental role. The system has been implemented as software modules for the EyesWeb XMI platform (http://www.eyesweb.org). It has been used in experimental frameworks (a violin duo and a string quartet) and in real-world applications (in user-centric applications for active music listening). Further application scenarios include entertainment, edutainment, therapy and rehabilitation, cultural heritage, and museum applications. Research has been carried out in the framework of the EU-ICT FP7 Project SAME (http://www.sameproject.eu).},

abstract = {Recommendation algorithms are best known for their use on e-commerce Web sites, where they use input about a customer's interests to generate a list of recommended items. Many applications use only the items that customers purchase and explicitly rate to represent their interests, but they can also use other attributes, including items viewed, demographic data, subject interests, and favorite artists. At Amazon.com, we use recommendation algorithms to personalize the online store for each customer. The store radically changes based on customer interests, showing programming titles to a software engineer and baby toys to a new mother. There are three common approaches to solving the recommendation problem: traditional collaborative filtering, cluster models, and search-based methods. Here, we compare these methods with our algorithm, which we call item-to-item collaborative filtering. Unlike traditional collaborative filtering, our algorithm's online computation scales independently of the number of customers and number of items in the product catalog. Our algorithm produces recommendations in real-time, scales to massive data sets, and generates high quality recommendations.},

@article{zhang2010affective,
abstract = {In modern times, music video (MV) has become an important favorite pastime to people because of its conciseness, convenience, and the ability to bring both audio and visual experiences to audiences. As the amount of MVs is explosively increasing, it has become an important task to develop new techniques for effective MV analysis, retrieval, and management. By stimulating the human affective response mechanism, affective video content analysis extracts the affective information contained in videos, and, with the affective information, natural, user-friendly, and effective MV access strategies could be developed. In this paper, a novel integrated system (i.MV) is proposed for personalized MV affective analysis, visualization, and retrieval. In i.MV, we not only perform the personalized MV affective analysis, which is a challenging and insufficiently covered problem in current affective content analysis field, but also propose novel affective visualization to convert the abstract affective states intuitive and friendly to users. Based on the affective analysis and visualization, affective information based MV retrieval is achieved. Both comprehensive experiments and subjective user studies on a large MV dataset demonstrate that our personalized affective analysis is more effective than the previous algorithms. In addition, affective visualization is proved to be more suitable for affective information-based MV retrieval than the commonly used affective state representation strategies.},

abstract = {There is an increasing amount of multimedia content available to end users. Recommender systems help these end users by selecting a small but relevant subset of items for each user based on her/his preferences. This paper investigates the influence of affective metadata (metadata that describe the user’s emotions) on the performance of a content-based recommender (CBR) system for images. The underlying assumption is that affective parameters are more closely related to the user’s experience than generic metadata (e.g. genre) and are thus more suitable for separating the relevant items from the non-relevant. We propose a novel affective modeling approach based on users’ emotive responses. We performed a user-interaction session and compared the performance of the recommender system with affective versus generic metadata. The results of the statistical analysis showed that the proposed affective parameters yield a significant improvement in the performance of the recommender system.},

@article{kim2008emotion,
abstract = {Little attention has been paid so far to physiological signals for emotion recognition compared to audiovisual emotion channels such as facial expression or speech. This paper investigates the potential of physiological signals as reliable channels for emotion recognition. All essential stages of an automatic recognition system are discussed, from the recording of a physiological dataset to a feature-based multiclass classification. In order to collect a physiological dataset from multiple subjects over many weeks, we used a musical induction method which spontaneously leads subjects to real emotional states, without any deliberate lab setting. Four-channel biosensors were used to measure electromyogram, electrocardiogram, skin conductivity and respiration changes. A wide range of physiological features from various analysis domains, including time/frequency, entropy, geometric analysis, subband spectra, multiscale entropy, etc., is proposed in order to find the best emotion-relevant features and to correlate them with emotional states. The best features extracted are specified in detail and their effectiveness is proven by classification results. Classification of four musical emotions (positive/high arousal, negative/high arousal, negative/low arousal, positive/low arousal) is performed by using an extended linear discriminant analysis (pLDA). Furthermore, by exploiting a dichotomic property of the 2D emotion model, we develop a novel scheme of emotion-specific multilevel dichotomous classification (EMDC) and compare its performance with direct multiclass classification using the pLDA. Improved recognition accuracy of 95$\backslash$\% and 70$\backslash$\% for subject-dependent and subject-independent classification, respectively, is achieved by using the EMDC scheme.},

Drowsy driver detection system is one of the potential applications of intelligent vehicle systems. Previous approaches to drowsiness detection primarily make pre-assumptions about the relevant behavior, focusing on blink rate, eye closure, and yawning. Here we employ machine learning to datamine actual human behavior during drowsiness episodes. Automatic classifiers for 30 facial actions from the Facial Action Coding system were developed using machine learning on a separate database of spontaneous expressions. These facial actions include blinking and yawn motions, as well as a number of other facial movements. In addition, head motion was collected through automatic eye tracking and an accelerometer. These measures were passed to learning-based classifiers such as Adaboost and multinomial ridge regression. The system was able to predict sleep and crash episodes during a driving computer game with 96\% accuracy within subjects and above 90\% accuracy across subjects. This is the highest prediction rate reported to date for detecting real drowsiness. Moreover, the analysis revealed new information about human behavior during drowsy driving.},

abstract = {Two data sources--self-reports and peer ratings--and two instruments--adjective factors and questionnaire scales--were used to assess the five-factor model of personality. As in a previous study of self-reports (McCrae \& Costa, 1985b), adjective factors of neuroticism, extraversion, openness to experience, agreeableness-antagonism, and conscientiousness-undirectedness were identified in an analysis of 738 peer ratings of 275 adult subjects. Intraclass correlations among raters, ranging from .30 to .65, and correlations between mean peer ratings and self-reports, from .25 to .62, showed substantial cross-observer agreement on all five adjective factors. Similar results were seen in analyses of scales from the NEO Personality Inventory. Items from the adjective factors were used as guides in a discussion of the nature of the five factors. These data reinforce recent appeals for the adoption of the five-factor model in personality research and assessment.},

The shift of focus from an individual to a group makes more of a difference than one might at first expect. This chapter discusses the most important new issues that arise, organizing them in terms of four subtasks that can or must be dealt with by a group recommender: 1. acquiring information about the user’s preferences; 2. generating recommendations; 3. explaining recommendations; and 4. helping users to settle on a final decision. For each issue, we discuss how it has been dealt with in existing group recommender systems and what open questions call for further research.},

abstract = {A fully automated, multi-stage architecture for emotion recognition is presented. Faces are located using a tracker based upon the ratio template algorithm [1]. Optical flow of the face is subsequently determined using a multi-channel gradient model [2]. The speed and direction information produced is then averaged over different parts of the face and ratios taken to determine how facial parts are moving relative to one another. This information is entered into multi-layer perceptrons trained using back propagation. The system then allocates any facial expression to one of four categories, happiness, sadness, surprise, or disgust. The three key stages of the architecture are all inspired by biological systems. This emotion recognition system runs in real-time and has a range of applications in the field of human-computer interaction.},

@article{zhang2005active,
abstract = {This paper explores the use of multisensory information fusion technique with Dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) for modeling and understanding the temporal behaviors of facial expressions in image sequences. Our facial feature detection and tracking based on active IR illumination provides reliable visual information under variable lighting and head motion. Our approach to facial expression recognition lies in the proposed dynamic and probabilistic framework based on combining DBNs with Ekman's Facial Action Coding System (FACS) for systematically modeling the dynamic and stochastic behaviors of spontaneous facial expressions. The framework not only provides a coherent and unified hierarchical probabilistic framework to represent spatial and temporal information related to facial expressions, but also allows us to actively select the most informative visual cues from the available information sources to minimize the ambiguity in recognition. The recognition of facial expressions is accomplished by fusing not only from the current visual observations, but also from the previous visual evidences. Consequently, the recognition becomes more robust and accurate through explicitly modeling temporal behavior of facial expression. In this paper, we present the theoretical foundation underlying the proposed probabilistic and dynamic framework for facial expression modeling and understanding. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can accurately and robustly recognize spontaneous facial expressions from an image sequence under different conditions.},

annote = {This paper $\backslash$cite\{Dasgupta2008\} examines the communications patterns of millions of mobile phone users, allowing us to study the underlying social network in a large-scale communication network. Traditional solutions have used data mining techniques that create a customer profile from her calling pattern, and then predict the probability of churn based on certain attributes of a subscriber. In this case social connections of users are analysed. Using only calls data from CDR-s, social network graph is made and based on intensity of connetions to past churners future churners are predicted. The method used is called Spreading Activation technique (SPA). Results (lift curve) show that SPA is generally successful in making correct predictions about 50-60\% of future churners, by contacting a relatively small fraction (10-20\%) of subscribers. In future they plan to extract additional CDR information (e.g. inter-region calls, SMS records, etc.). They also compare this method to J48 Weka classifier (decision trees). A traditional (label) attributes-based classifier loses out to SPA because it fails to adequately learn all the ties in the network neighbourhood. Further gains in the prediction accuracy can be potentially achieved by applying link mining techniques, based on collective classification.},

abstract = {Little attention has been paid so far to physiological signals for emotion recognition compared to audiovisual emotion channels such as facial expression or speech. This paper investigates the potential of physiological signals as reliable channels for emotion recognition. All essential stages of an automatic recognition system are discussed, from the recording of a physiological dataset to a feature-based multiclass classification. In order to collect a physiological dataset from multiple subjects over many weeks, we used a musical induction method which spontaneously leads subjects to real emotional states, without any deliberate lab setting. Four-channel biosensors were used to measure electromyogram, electrocardiogram, skin conductivity and respiration changes. A wide range of physiological features from various analysis domains, including time/frequency, entropy, geometric analysis, subband spectra, multiscale entropy, etc., is proposed in order to find the best emotion-relevant features and to correlate them with emotional states. The best features extracted are specified in detail and their effectiveness is proven by classification results. Classification of four musical emotions (positive/high arousal, negative/high arousal, negative/low arousal, positive/low arousal) is performed by using an extended linear discriminant analysis (pLDA). Furthermore, by exploiting a dichotomic property of the 2D emotion model, we develop a novel scheme of emotion-specific multilevel dichotomous classification (EMDC) and compare its performance with direct multiclass classification using the pLDA. Improved recognition accuracy of 95$\backslash$\% and 70$\backslash$\% for subject-dependent and subject-independent classification, respectively, is achieved by using the EMDC scheme.},

abstract = {Genius is a popular commercial music recommender sys- tem that is based on collaborative filtering of huge amounts of user data. To understand the aspects of music similarity that collaborative filtering can capture, we compare Genius to two canonical music recommender systems: one based purely on artist similarity, the other purely on similarity of acoustic content. We evaluate this comparison with a user study of 185 subjects. Overall, Genius produces the best recommendations. We demonstrate that collaborative filter- ing can actually capture similarities between the acoustic content of songs. However, when evaluators can see the names of the recommended songs and artists, we find that artist similarity can account for the performance of Genius. A system that combines these musical cues could generate music recommendations that are as good as Genius, even when collaborative filtering data is unavailable.},

@article{Wang2008,
abstract = {—Machine recognition of human emotional state is an important component for efficient human-computer interaction. The majority of existing works address this problem by utilizing audio signals alone, or visual information only. In this paper, we explore a systematic approach for recognition of human emotional state from audiovisual signals. The audio characteristics of emo- tional speech are represented by the extracted prosodic, Mel-fre- quency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC), and formant frequency fea- tures. A face detection scheme based on HSV color model is used to detect the face from the background. The visual information is represented by Gabor wavelet features.We perform feature selec- tion by using a stepwise method based on Mahalanobis distance. The selected audiovisual features are used to classify the data into their corresponding emotions. Based on a comparative study of different classification algorithms and specific characteristics of individual emotion, a novel multiclassifier scheme is proposed to boost the recognition performance. The feasibility of the proposed system is tested over a database that incorporates human subjects from different languages and cultural backgrounds. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system. The multiclassifier scheme achieves the best overall recognition rate of 82.14\%.},

Based on the theory of planned behavior, the study revealed that hunters, wildlife viewers, and other outdoor recreationists differ greatly in terms of their beliefs about the outcomes of these behaviors and in terms of their attitudes, subjective norms, and perceptions of behavioral control, as well as wildlife-related values and values to life in general. Preferred ac- tivities were perceived as producing more desirable outcomes than less pre- ferred activities, and they were associated with more favorable attitudes, subjective norms, and perceptions of control. They also reflected broad value orientations to wildlife and to life in general. These findings suggest that some activities are better suited than others to produce desired benefits for different types of individuals, and that outdoor recreationists need to be served in different ways to optimize the benefits they derive.},

Attitudes were related to beliefs about short- and long-term consequences; subjective norms reflected perceived expectations of family, teachers, and friends; and control considerations included requisite academic abilities, conflict with peers and teachers, and distracting life conditions. Intentions and, to a lesser extent, perceived behavioral control, predicted graduation almost 3 years later (R ? .50; p ? .01). The findings indicate opportunities for early interventions.},

abstract = {Relying on the theory of planned behavior (Ajzen, 1991), a longitudinal study investigated the effects of an intervention-introduction of a prepaid bus ticket-on increased bus use among college students. In this context, the logic of the proposition that past behavior is the best predictor of later behavior was also examined. The intervention was found to influence attitudes toward bus use, subjective norms, and perceptions of behavioral control and, consistent with the theory, to affect intentions and behavior in the desired direction. Furthermore, the theory afforded accurate prediction of intention and behavior both before and after the intervention. In contrast, a measure of past behavior improved prediction of travel mode prior to the intervention, but lost its predictive utility for behavior following the intervention. In a test of the proposition that the effect of past on later behavior is due to habit formation, an independent measure of habit failed to mediate the effects of past on later behavior. It is concluded that choice of travel mode is largely a reasoned decision; that this decision can be affected by interventions that produce change in attitudes, subjective norms, and perceptions of behavioral control; and that past travel choice contributes to the prediction of later behavior only if circumstances remain relatively stable.

@incollection{Ajzen2007,
abstract = {(from the chapter) Human behavior is at the centre of much research in the health domain because of its potential contribution to the myriad of medical conditions that afflict people every day. The detrimental health effects of cigarette smoking, alcohol and drug abuse, lack of exercise, poor nutrition, and so forth are well documented. These lifestyle behaviours increase, among other things, the risk for various types of cancer, emphysema, coronary heart disease, diabetes, osteoporosis, and sleep disorders. Besides raising morbidity, these behaviours can also have a generally detrimental impact on quality of life. In the first part of this chapter we use a reasoned action approach, the theory of planned behaviour, to examine the causal antecedents of health-related behaviours, asking why people perform, or fail to perform, recommended health practices. A good understanding of these antecedents is of interest in its own right but, equally important, it is essential for designing effective intervention programmes, a topic we address in the second part of this chapter. We illustrate the potential utility of the theory of planned behaviour in this regard and then focus on one particular problem faced by any reasoned action approach, the question of behavioural routines, habits, and addictions.

As is evident in this volume, consumer psychologists employ the concepts, theories, and fi ndings of psychology—and in particular of social psychol- ogy—to explain the behavior of the consumer (see Bagozzi, G\"{u}rhan-Canli, \& Priester, 2002; Simon- son, Carmon, Dhar, Drolet, \& Nowlis, 2000).

@misc{IcekAjzen2011,
abstract = {In this article the author takes issue with the recurrent reliance on job satisfaction to explain job- related effort and performance. The disappointing findings in this tradition are explained by lack of compatibility between job satisfaction–-a very broad attitude–-and the more specific effort and performance criteria. Moreover, attempts to apply the expectancy-value model of attitude to ex- plore the determinants of effort and performance suffer from reliance on unrepresentative sets of beliefs about the likely consequences of these behaviors. The theory of planned behavior (Ajzen, 1991, 2012), with its emphasis on the proximal antecedents of job effort and performance, is of- fered as an alternative. According to the theory, intentions to exert effort and to attain a certain performance level are determined by attitudes, subjective norms, and perceptions of control in relation to these behaviors; and these variables, in turn, are a function of readily accessible beliefs about the likely outcomes of effort and performance, about the normative expectations of impor- tant others, and about factors that facilitate or hinder effective performance},

@article{Jaccard2012,
abstract = {The reasoned action model (RAM) of Fishbein and Ajzen has been highly influential in the social and health sciences. This article describes three areas for future research that should expand its explanatory power. One area of research focuses on an idiographic RAM that encourages researchers to pursue the estimation of RAM parameters on a per-individual level rather than through traditional nomothetic modeling. The second area encourages scientists to develop a split-second RAM, that is, a RAM that can provide perspectives on the split-second decisions people make in everyday life. Integration of the RAM with models of working (short-term) memory is stressed. The third area for research encourages scientists to develop a multioption RAM that incorporates and is responsive to the choices that people make when confronted with multiple alternatives. This perspective stresses the need to apply the RAM to the full range of behavioral options that are available to people as they contemplate performing one behavior versus another. Perspectives for theoretical advancement in each area are developed.},

Using structural equation modeling concepts, the authors identify two elements of reasoned action data: the structural component relating theoretical variables to one another and a measurement component defining the theoretical constructs. The authors then describe a three-step analytic approach: analyzing the proximal determinants of intention to perform a behavior, analyzing the underlying beliefs, and performing a segmentation analysis for intervention design purposes. In each step, when appropriate, the authors discuss the role of background/precursor variables. The authors conclude by addressing several common analytic issues that may arise when conducting a reasoned action analysis, such as the role of past behavior and testing for moderation.},

@misc{Ajzen1991,
abstract = {Research dealing with various aspects of the theory of planned behavior (Ajzen, 1985, 1987) is reviewed, and some unresolved issues are discussed. In broad terms, the theory is found to be well supported by empirical evidence. Intentions to perform behaviors of different kinds can be predicted with high accuracy from attitudes toward the behavior, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control; and these intentions, together with perceptions of behavioral control, account for considerable variance in actual behavior. Attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control are shown to be related to appropriate sets of salient behavioral, normative, and control beliefs about the behavior, but the exact nature of these relations is still uncertain. Expectancy-value formulations are found to be only partly successful in dealing with these relations. Optimal rescaling of expectancy and value measures is offered as a means of dealing with measurement limitations. Finally, inclusion of past behavior in the prediction equation is shown to provide a means of testing the theory's sufficiency, another issue that remains unresolved. The limited available evidence concerning this question shows that the theory is predicting behavior quite well in comparison to the ceiling imposed by behavioral reliability.},

abstract = {Despite being identified as an unsafe (and, in some jurisdictions, illegal) driving practice, the psychological factors underlying people's decision to use their mobile phone while driving have received little attention. The present study utilised the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) to examine the role of attitudes, norms, control factors, and risk perceptions, in predicting people's intentions to use their mobile phone while driving. We examined the predictors of intentions to use a mobile phone while driving in general, and for calling and text messaging in 4 scenarios differing in descriptions of vehicle speed and time pressure. There was some support for the TPB given that attitudes consistently predicted intentions to drive while using a mobile phone and that pressure from significant others (norms) determined some phone use while driving intentions, although less support was found for the role of perceptions of control. Risk was not generally predictive of safer driving intentions. These findings indicate that different factors influence each form of mobile phone use while driving and, hence, a multi-strategy approach is likely to be required to address the issue.},
